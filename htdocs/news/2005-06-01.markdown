Tntnet version 1.4.0pre2
========================

changes
-------

Removed boost dependency. Tntnet uses now the POSIX.2-regex instead of
boost-regex. This greatly simplifies installation and also reduces
binary-size. Also a memory-leak in 1.4.0pre1 was fixed.


There is a users-guide (in open-office-format) and a yet unfinished
configuration-guide.


I tested this release successfully with gcc-4.0.1, which greatly improves
performance (about 20% faster compared to 3.3.4).
