===============================================================

Its update time. These releases are the result of 2 years of development whith
many improvements.

This release adds json and jsonrpc to cxxtools as well as a fast binary rpc server and client. Both are based on the improved serialization framework of cxxtools.

The json and binary format can be used as a storage format. Also serialization and deserialization of csv is possible.

The unicode string as a specialization of `std::basic_string` got a major rewrite with short string optimization.

Tntnet has mainly many small improvements, better standard compliance and a slightly higher performance.

Tntdb got a replication driver, which is able to replicate the data between
databases without database support. The decimal class was rewritten and got
unittests. The new RowReader-class makes code more readable, when many columns
are read from a result row. A new class BlobStream implements a `std::istream`
interface to blobs.
