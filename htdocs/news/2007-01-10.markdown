development version 1.5.3.1 of tntnet
=====================================


I've done some tweaks and enhancements in Tntnet, which improoves usability as well as performance.
The most major improvements are:

  * VMapUrl for virtual host specific url-mapping
  * use epoll instead of poll when available, which improves scalability
  * option "-I dir" to specify include-directory for ecppc
  * building of sdk and demos can be supressed, when building tntnet
  * remove global factory-symbol, which removes naming-conflicts in different shared libraries
