Development version 1.5.2pre3 of Tntnet
=======================================

Tntnet has now thread-scoped variables as a addition to applicatin-
session- and request-scope. Just declare a section &lt;%thread&gt; and
put your variables there. This is useful, e.g. for databaseconnections.
Escpecially for sqlite3, where connections can't be used in other threads,
than the one, who issued sqlite3_open.

Tntnet handles http-headers and cookies case-insensitive know. It was
a bug, not to do it.

Components aren't deleted any more before the thread ends. Until know
Tntnet had a special cleaner thread, which deleted components,
which aren't used any more. This was not that useful, because components
don't eat much memory and it is really a waste of time to do asyncronous
cleanup without gaining much.

Tntnet has new demos: calcajax and chat shows, how to use ajax with
Tntnet; alldemos shows a (configurable) page with links to all other demos.
