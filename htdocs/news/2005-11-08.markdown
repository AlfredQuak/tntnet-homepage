Tntnet version 1.5.0pre5 and cxxtools 1.4.0pre3
===============================================


  Thread-class in cxxtools is now split into DetachedThread and AttachedThread.
  In Tntnet the workers are derived from DetachedThread. This fixes a major
  bug, which could trigger a unnecesery emergency-restart.
