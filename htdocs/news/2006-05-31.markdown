development version 1.5.2pre1 of Tntnet, version 1.4.2pre1 of cxxtools
======================================================================

These are bugfix-releases. Applications based on cxxtools (like Tntnet)
failed to start on systems without IPv6. Some warnings are removed. Tntnet
compiles now with OpenSSL on OpenBSD.
