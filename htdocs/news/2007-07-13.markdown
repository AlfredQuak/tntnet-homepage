new develpment version 1.6.0.2 of tntnet
========================================

In this version the locale can be set in components with SET_LANG
(e.g. SET_LANG("de_DE") ). Http-classes are restructured.
`HttpReply::notAuthorized` and `HttpReply::redirect` throw exceptions to make it
easy to call them in subcomponents.
