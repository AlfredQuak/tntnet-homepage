new version 1.4.5 of cxxtools
=============================

A policy-based smart-pointer-class is included here. I have used this implementation
in tntdb for some time and copied it to many projects since then. Therefore I decided
to finally include it into my toolbox. The default policy is intrusive reference counted,
which is the safest model. The objects held need to have methods "addRef" and "release".
This is easily done by using `cxxtools::RefCounted` as a (additional?) base-class.

I have rewritten the parser for ini-files. The new parser is much cleaner. The
parser is separated from the data-structure, which makes it possible to use the
parser separately. The interface to the class has changed heavily, so you need to
port your application to the new class, if you have used this part of cxxtools.

I also wrote a parser for property-files, which are quite popular in the java-world.
They have the advantage to support hieracial structures, while beeing still easily
readable and writable.
