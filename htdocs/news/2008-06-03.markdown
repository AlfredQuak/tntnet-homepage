stable versions cxxtools 1.4.8, tntnet 1.6.3 and tntdb 1.0.1
============================================================

These versions mainly fix some bugs found in the last weeks.

The regex-wrapper classes from tntnet are now copied to cxxtools and are
fully functional now. Cxxtools also got a set of conversion functions as easy
to use wrappers around `std::stringstream.` The so-number is increased to
indicate binary incompatiblity to older versions (at least &lt;= 1.4.6)

Clearing cookies was broken since about a year. This is fixed now. Quotes
and double quotes in c++ comments in ecpp files was not handled correctly.
Initialization of scoped variables may expand to multiple lines now (this was
actually intended behaviour before, but incorrectly implemented). Here also the
so-number was increased.

The sqlite-driver of tntdb had 2 small bugs. Setting strings in statements
did not lead to equality when compared to columns. Using multiple cursors for
one statement crashed tntdb when the cursors were released in reverse order.
