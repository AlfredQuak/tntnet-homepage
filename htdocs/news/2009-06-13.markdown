development versions cxxtools 1.99.4, tntnet 1.6.99 and tntdb 1.0.99
====================================================================

Cxxtools has make a quantum leap forward to a general purpose C++ library.
This version adds a fast template based signal slot framework, a serialization
system, asyncronous I/O with iostreams, a http server and a improved http
client, XML reader and writer, and a great XMLRCP client and server.

Tntnet and Tntdb has got some minor bug fixes and are adjusted to the API
changes in cxxtools (which are quite small).
