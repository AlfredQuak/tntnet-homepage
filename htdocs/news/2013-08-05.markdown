new homepage
============

We have a new homepage. Thank you for those who helped creating this.

The homepage not only runs with tntnet but also uses tntnet technology. This
makes it much easier to maintain the content.

We had the doxygen generated API documentation and some howtos. Now we have also
the man pages online. The man pages have been the actual reference for tntnet
for quite some time but they were difficult to find. Now I hope, that people
will get informations about tntnet easier and faster.
