tntdb updated to 0.6.4
======================

Tntdb has got a driver for oracle. Now it supports sqlite, mysql, postgresql
and oracle. The driver is not compiled by default, but must be activated by
passing --with-oracle to the configure-script.

Another fine update is support for decimals (thank you Mark Write).

And for those of you, who misses tntdb 0.6.3: I once packed a 0.6.3, but I
discovered some bugs before announcement, so I decided just to skip it.
