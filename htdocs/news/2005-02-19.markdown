cxxtools version 1.3.0
======================

changes
-------

The socket-classes got some improvements. It handles timeout better now.


cxxtools-config is a configuration-script, to help compile against cxxtools
(escpecially cxxtools-log) easier. It also has the ability to generate a
suitable configurationfile for the underlying logging-library.
