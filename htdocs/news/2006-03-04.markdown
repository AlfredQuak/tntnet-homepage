Tntnet version 1.5.0, cxxtools 1.4.0
====================================


 I finally declared Tntnet 1.5.0 and cxxtools 1.4.0 as stable, just because
 they are. Tntnet 1.5.0 is faster than ever and has gone through many
 stability- and speed-tests, which makes it rock-solid and incredibly fast.


 Cxxtools got a new logging-feature, which speeds up logging quite
 significantly. The parameter "flushdelay" enables a background-thread,
 which flushes the outputfile asynchronously. The logentries don't trigger
 a flush, so may logentries are written with one system-call.
 This results in a 15% speed-up of Tntnet in simple cases. Without it
 dynamic pages are just as fast as static pages in apache2. With
 delayed flush Tntnet is well ahead of apache2.
