development version 1.5.1pre3 of Tntnet, version 1.4.1pre1 of cxxtools and
version 0.6.2 of Tntdb
=================================================================================================

Logging with Cxxtools is optimized. This results in a 30% speed-up. A new
`std::ostream-derived` class `cxxtools::Streamcounter` is included, which just counts the
characters, which are printed. The rolling-file-appender uses it to monitor filesize,
which make flushdelay to work with it.

In Tntdb 0.6.2 the mysql-driver got some bugfixes. Fetching some datatypes (e.g. timestamp)
resulted in a crash, because the Mysql-API returns too small lengths (or I misunderstand
the API;-) ).

Tntnet extends the license to allow linking with openssl. Some ANSI-C++-violations
are fixed. A new demo newsdb is added, which demonstrates, how to access a database with
Tntdb from a web application. The documentation was reformatted to use only standard fonts,
which reduces the size of the tarball.
