stable versions cxxtools 2.0, tntnet 2.0 and tntdb 1.1 released
===============================================================

After more than 2 years new without stable releases it is time for updates.
Cxxtools has hot huge improvements and feature enhancements like xmlrpc, a
signal slot framework, anynchronous I/O and others.

This implied some API changes. Still most of the existing code should run.
Tntnet and tntdb needed some changes for this, so that the new tntnet and tntdb
releases need cxxtools 2.0.

Tntnet has got many small feature and performance enhancements. Luckily
there was no much need for API changes. Almost applications should run out of
the box by recompiling.

Tntdb got some feature enhancements. Most important are maybe the support
for auto incremented values using the method
`tntdb::Connection::lastInsertId(std::string)` and support for user defined
types by overloading 2 operators.
