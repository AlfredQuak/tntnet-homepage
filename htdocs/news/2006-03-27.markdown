development version 1.5.1pre2 of Tntnet and new version 0.6.1 of Tntdb
======================================================================


Here is another development-version of Tntnet. This version teaches the
precompiler to generate #line-directives. Error-messages of the c++-compiler
now point directly into to ecpp-source instead of the (intermediate) output of the
precompiler.


Tntdb 0.6.1 fixes some minor bugs and makes some small improvements.
The postgresql-driver allows now cursors outside transactions. Passing
date-, datetime- and time-classes to statements may be null.
