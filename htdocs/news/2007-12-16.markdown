new stable versions, cxxtools 1.4.6, tntnet 1.6.1, tntdb 0.9.5
==============================================================

The features released in the development releases are considered stable
now.

Cxxtools have got some feature enhancements like support for signal-slot
and wrappers for atomic functions. Locking in logger-classes is reduced, so
that threads do not need to wait for other threads when logging. Logging may be
passed to a subprocess, which can run under a different user, when the main
process starts as root.

Tntdb has support for blobs. And this time the archive is complete. The
0.9.4 release lacked some important files, so if you had problems with that it
was purely my fault ;-).

The main enhancement in tntnet was the move of most of the tntnet-code into
the library, so it is easy to use tntnet in applications. Also a wrapper for
fork was added, since it is somewhat dangerous to start subprocesses without
that, since subprocesses will block restarts, since they inherit listener
ports. To fork subprocesses in tntnet-applications use this:

<pre>
  if (request.getApplication().forkProcess())
  {
    // here we are in child process
    exit(0);  // this or exec... is mandatory!!!
  }
</pre>
