new development versions of cxxtools 1.4.5.1 and tntnet 1.6.0.4
===============================================================

Cxxtools gets a fast template based signal-slot implementation from Marc.
Libltdl is replaced by a simple dlopen-wrapper. The smart pointer gets an
additional destroy policy.

Most of the code of tntnet is moved to libtntnet to make it possible to
embed tntnet in applications.
